# RSA Cryptosystem

RSA Cryptosystem is a JavaFX application for displaying RSA encryption and decryption algorithms.


## Usage
*All steps need to be done in order for appropriate results*!
### Encryption
**Step 1: Calculating p and q**

1. Fill in a number for: n
2. Press on **Step 1** for the result of p and q.

 *If nothing happens take another value for n. This could happen because p and q both need to be prime numbers.*

**Step 2: Calculating e**

1. Press on **Step 2** to calculate: e

**Step 3: Encrypting the message**

1. Fill in your desired text to be encrypted into the text area below ***Encryption Message***
2. Press on **Step 3** to encrypt your message

### Decryption
**Step 1: Calculating d**
1. Fill in a number for: n
2. Fill in a number for: e
3. Press on **Step 1** for the result of d

**Step 2: Decrypting the message**

1. Fill in your desired cipher text to be decrypted into the text area below ***Message for decryption***
2. Press on **Step 2** to decrypt your message
